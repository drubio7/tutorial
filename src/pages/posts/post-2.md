# The 'original sin' in Pharmally deal

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">Like a fish caught by the mouth, former Health Secretary Francisco Duque III revealed what many had already guessed, but dared not say: that then-President Rodrigo Duterte had ordered the transfer of P47.6 billion from the coffers of the Department of Health (DOH) to the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM), supposedly to procure COVID-19 supplies at the height of the pandemic.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">As bombshells go, it wasn’t exactly earth-shattering, but one that gave clarity to lingering questions on the political firestorm that rocked the country two years ago. That fateful order—a presidential directive as it now appears—was the “original sin” believed to have set the stage for the anomalous deal of plunderous proportions.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">The presidential order allowed a little-known company called Pharmally Pharmaceutical Corp., with a paid-up capital of P625,000, to corner pandemic contracts worth billions of pesos as facilitated by PS-DBM. All told, Pharmally would secure, between March 2020 and July 2021, deals that totaled P11 billion to supply DOH with personal protective equipment sets, face masks, face shields, COVID-19 test kits, and other medical items.</span>
